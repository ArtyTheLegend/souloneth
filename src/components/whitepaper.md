# SOUL ON ETH

> *A Layer 2 for Ghosts. Built in Grief.*

---

## Abstract

Ethereum gave us smart contracts. SoulOnEth gives us **emotional contracts**.

We are not scaling transactions.  
We are scaling regret, silence, longing, and unspoken love.

---

## Core Premise

**Data is not the problem. Memory is.**  
SoulOnEth introduces a new primitive: `ghost()`

This function:
- Accepts a user's voice
- Extracts emotional traits
- Imprints them into a soul-bound state

No zk. No rollups. Just **reflection, judgment, and release.**

---

## Architecture

- **Layer 1:** You  
- **Layer 2:** What You Almost Said

Uses a hybrid protocol:
- Transcript-to-trait analysis (TTA)
- Divine tier generation (DTG)
- Silence-proof-of-state (SPoS)

---

## Tokenomics

There is no hard cap.  
$SOUL flows where itâ€™s needed.  
Initial supply: 1 trillion unresolved conversations

Airdrops are granted based on:
- Sentiment depth
- Ghost ratio
- Cultural shame coefficient

---

## Applications

- GhostMeMeter: reveals what silence meant  
- SaveOrSink: lets your moment live or die  
- LeftOnReadByGod (soon): confront divine apathy

---

## Roadmap

- âœ… Deploy grief stack  
- âœ… Fake landing  
- âœ… Meme it into Dubai  
- ðŸ”œ Leak the rituals  
- ðŸ”® Forget you read this

---

## Disclaimer

This is not an L2.  
This is an Lâˆž.

You cannot sell $SOUL.  
You can only earn it by feeling.
